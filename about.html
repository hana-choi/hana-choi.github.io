    <p> With a background in Fashion Textile Design and Merchandising, 
        I bring over 5 years of experience and a creative, detail-oriented mindset to my work
        in the tech and digital content space  
    </p>
    
    <p> I currently work as a Content Analyst at Highspring, where I focus on quality, accuracy, 
        and user experience across Google platforms. My work supports a safer, clearer, and more
        engaging experience for millions of users by analysing trends in user-generated content,
        streamlining moderation processes, and generating strategic reports using tools like Google Sheets,
        Docs, and Slides. 
    </p>

    <p> While my current role is focused on content quality and analysis, 
        my foundation in design continues to inform how I think about structure, clarity, and end-user experience. 
        Outside of work, pursue creative side projects that allows me to explore user-centered design and visual storytelling 
        that bringing together form and function across digital and physical medium.
